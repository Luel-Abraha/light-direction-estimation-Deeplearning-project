# Light Direction Estimation from Shadows

This project estimates light direction in images by analyzing the relationship between objects and their shadows. It uses Detectron2 for instance segmentation and Depth Anything for depth estimation.

## Features

- Detect objects and their shadows in images
- Estimate 3D light direction vectors
- Generate 3D visualizations with Open3D
- Export 3D models in PLY, OBJ, and GLB formats

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/light-direction-estimation.git
   cd light-direction-estimation
